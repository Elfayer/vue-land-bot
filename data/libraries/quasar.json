    "Quasar (pronounced /ˈkweɪ.zɑɹ/) is an MIT licensed open-source Vue.js based framework, which allows you as a web developer to quickly create responsive++ websites/apps in many flavours:",
    "• SPAs (Single Page App)",
    "• SSR (Server-side Rendered App) (+ optional PWA client takeover)",
    "• PWAs (Progressive Web App)",
    "• Mobile Apps (Android, iOS, …) through Apache Cordova",
    "• Multi-platform Desktop Apps (using Electron)",
    "Quasar’s motto is: write code once and simultaneously deploy it as a website, a Mobile App and/or an Electron App. Yes, one codebase for all of them, helping you develop an app in record time by using a state of the art CLI and backed by best-practice, blazing fast Quasar web components.",
    "When using Quasar, you won’t need additional heavy libraries like Hammerjs, Momentjs or Bootstrap. It’s got those needs covered internally, and all with a small footprint!"
