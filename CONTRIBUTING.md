## Commit Conventions

We try to (at least vaguely) follow the [Angular commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines), though with some minor adjustments.

- `build`: Affects the build process/development
  - **Examples:** Changes to npm, babel, webpack, typescript, prettier, eslint, pm2 etc. config files
  - **NOTE:** Used to be categorised as `chore`
- `docs`: Relates to the documentation
- `enhance`: Modifies an _existing feature_ (an enhancement/improvement)
- `feat`: Adds a brand new feature
- `fix`: Fixes a bug/issue
- `perf`: Improves performance
- `refactor`: A (generally large-scale) change which doesn't fall under change, feat, fix or style
- `style`: Smaller-scale refactorings
  - **Examples:** White-space, formatting, naming/wording/phrasing, unused imports etc.
- `test`: Relates to tests
